ZX Terminal
===========

ZX Terminal is a terminal emulator for ZX Spectrum and Timex 2048
with the spectranet. There are two parts: Spectrum and Unix(Linux).
The Linux part requires libvterm (tested with 0.99.7), ncurses (5.9)
and glib2. The Spectrum part requires z88dk and the socklib from the spectranet.

There are 4 variants of the terminal:
- 85x24 for Timex hires (tmx85.c and timex.c)
- 64x24 for Timex hires (tmx64.c and timex.c)
- 64x24 color for ZX Spectrum (spc64_c.c and spectrum_c.c)
- 64x24 mono for ZX Spectrum (spc64_m.c and spectrum_m.c)

Build, type make.
And load the spectrum part on the spectrum, and run the Linux part.
For example:
./tmx85 127.0.0.2
