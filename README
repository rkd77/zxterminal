ZX Terminal
===========

ZX Terminal is a terminal emulator for ZX Spectrum and Timex 2048
with the spectranet. There are two parts: Spectrum and Unix(Linux).
The Linux part requires libvterm (tested with 0.99.7), ncurses (5.9)
and glib2. The Spectrum part requires z88dk and the socklib from the spectranet.

There are 5 variants of the terminal:
- 85x24 hires (timex.tap and tmx85)
- 80x24 hires (timex.tap and tmx80)
- 64x24 hires (timex.tap and tmx64)
- 64x24 color for ZX Spectrum (spectrum_c.tap and spc64_c)
- 64x24 mono for ZX Spectrum (spectrum_m.c and spc64_m)

To build, type make.

Load the appriopriate tape file on the Spectrum.
The Spectrum will listen on port 2000 for incoming connection.
Then run Unix part. The parameter is the IP address of the Spectrum.

On Timex:
LOAD "timex.tap"
On Unix:
./tmx85 127.0.0.2

I tested elinks, mc and bb.
mc need some tweaking (Learn keys).
Remember that CTRL-I is the TAB.

In fact, the zxterminal is not real terminal emulator.
Better name for it would be the framebuffer. In the infinite loop
Spectrum sends info about keypresses to remote machine.
In the same time the Unix part, one of (tmx85, tmx80, tmx64, spc64_c spc64_m)
builds Spectrum screen and sends it to the Spectrum.

The code is based on StreamingVideo example from Spectranet. At least the idea.
